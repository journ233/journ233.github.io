- Optional: [Codecademy: Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python/lessons/conditionals--control-flow/exercises/go-with-the-flow): `Conditionals and Control Flow` in Python 2 is VERY similar to Python 3.

#### Lecture: Control flow review

- [Slides](assets/static/slides1002.pdf) | [Recording](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1525907/external_tools/78985) 
- Next Monday is Indigenous People's Day, and there will be no lecture.

#### Homework
- You can re-submit [Homework 0925](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1525907/quizzes/2442761) by Oct. 14 for a new grade. (But there will be no extra credit given. The FizzBuzz question will no longer have the extra credit component — consider it part of the assignment. You will not get extra credit for writing tests, but you won't lose points if you don't write them. You will also not get extra credit for telling me how much time J233 took.)
- [Homework 1004](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1525907/quizzes/2445338) in bCourses due Oct. 14.
- Schedule office hours with me anytime through Oct. 13 on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/soooh/j233-final-project-chat) to have a loose chat about your final project. (Do not use my regular office hours link.) This is a graded assignment.
- Read [The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2020-043/)
- Optional: Codecademy has free [Python Cheat Sheets](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-python-3/tracks/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-hello-world/cheatsheet) - skip `Modules`, `Files`, and `Classes`

{#
- Read [5.3. Tuples and Sequences](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)
- Optional
  - The mandatory reading is on the tuples section (specifically 5.3). But the entirety of [Section 5](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) covers what we learned in this week's lecture, so it could be good to review. 
  - Python's [built-in methods for various types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) 
- [Homework 1003 in bCourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1512503/quizzes/2411384) due Oct. 15 (you get an extra week)
